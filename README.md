While tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Cline are making coding increasingly intelligent, and platforms like Dify, Flowise, and Coze enable drag-and-drop workflows, we developers still find ourselves wading through vast AI-less seas daily, wearied by the myriad tedious processes in development.

While some complex customization demands of enterprises have turned tool adaptation into tar pits, hands-on enthusiasts are busily engaged in various personalized tasks.
Every dev team has its own character and deserves tailored AI services, and implementing these shouldn‚Äôt be arduous.

We‚Äôve built the DevChat open-source community to help every developer effortlessly cross the last mile of LLM productivity!

## Core Features

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Simplified Personalization: Create Custom Workflows with a Few Sentences
- Say goodbye to the rigid and learning-intensive ‚Äúdrag-and-drop‚Äù workflow frameworks. With just a few sentences, you can easily generate intelligent workflows that assist or handle various tasks for you ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs submitting a standardized GitLab MR, generating API automated API test cases, or having the AI provide progress updates via voice notifications.
- Through the open-source community, we aim to build a rich collection of intelligent workflows, ranging from plugins that access rich IDE context to various autonomous agents, ensuring there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúmagical tool‚Äù that suits you.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Deep Understanding of Private Knowledge Through Knowledge Engineering
- Integrated knowledge graph capabilities support diverse semantic queries, combining static pre-construction before queries with dynamic construction during queries to balance optimal effectiveness and performance.
- Classify knowledge for specific scenarios to enhance AI generations.
  - For example, by analyzing all interfaces, parameters, and relationships in API documents, our AI autonomous testing tool can use multiple APIs to generate test cases, reducing exploratory steps and improving the quality of test scripts.
